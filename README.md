Along the way, it is expected to learn and improve concepts of the languages and their frameworks, infrastructure, RESTFULL APIs, CI/CD, TDD, design patterns...

To run the application it is necessary that it [contains the requirements](https://gorails.com/setup/osx/12-monterey#postgresql) and then:
```bash
rail server
```
